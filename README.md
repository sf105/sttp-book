# Software Testing: From Theory to Practice


![Book header](assets/img/header.jpg)


Welcome to **Software Testing: From Theory to Practice**!

This book covers the most important testing techniques needed to build high quality software systems. Specific topics covered are quality attributes, maintainability and testability, manual and exploratory testing, automated testing, DevOps, test adequacy, model-based testing, state-based testing, decision tables, reviews and inspections, design-by-contract, test-driven design, unit versus integration testing, mocks and stubs.

We expect readers to be able to:

* Create unit, integration, and system tests using current existing tools (i.e., JUnit, Mockito, and JaCoCo) that effectively test complex software systems.

* Derive test cases that deal with exceptional, corner, and bad weather cases by performing several different techniques (i.e., boundary analysis, state-based testing, decision tables)
as well as able to reflect about their limitations, when and when not to apply them in a given context.

* Measure and reflect about the efficiency of the developed test suites by means of different test adequacy metrics (i.e., line, branch, condition, MC/DC coverage).

* Design and implement testable software systems by means of architectural patterns such as dependency injection, and ports and adapters.

* Write maintainable test code by avoiding well-known test code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette, Slow or Obscure Tests).

*Target audience:* 1st year Computer Science students. Knowledge in programming is required. Code examples are in Java, although easily transferrable to other languages.
