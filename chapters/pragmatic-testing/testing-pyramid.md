# The Testing Pyramid

In previous chapters, we studied different techniques to derive test cases.
However, most of requirements we tested via specification-based techniques had a single responsibility. Most of the source code
we tested via structural-based techniques could fit in a single unit/class.

A large software system, however, is composed of many of those units/responsibilities. Together, they compose
the complex behaviour of our software system. 

In this chapter, we are going to discuss 
the different **test levels** (i.e., unit, integration, and system), their advantages and disadvantages, and the trade-offs that a tester has to do in real-world testing.

## Unit testing

In some situations, the goal of the tester is to test a single feature of the software, "purposefully ignoring the other units of the systems".
Like we have been doing so far. When we test units in isolation, 
we are doing what is called **unit testing**.

Defining what a 'unit' is, is challenging and highly dependent on the context.
A unit can be just one method, or can consist of multiple classes.
According to Roy Osherove's unit testing definition:
_"A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes a unit of work in the system.
And a unit of work can span a single method, a whole class or multiple classes working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified."_

As with any testing strategy, unit testing has advantages and disadvantages:

* Firstly, **unit tests are fast**.
A unit test usually takes just a couple of milliseconds to execute.
Fast tests give us the ability to test huge portions of the system in a small amount of time.
Automated test suites that are fast give developers constant feedback; this fast
safety net makes developers to feel
more comfortable/confident in performing evolutionary changes to the software system their work.

* Secondly, **unit tests are easy to control**. 
A unit test tests the software by giving certain parameters to a method and then comparing the return value of a method to the expected result.
The input values and expected result values are very easy to be adapted/modified in the test.

* Finally, **unit tests are easy to write**.
Unit tests do not require complicated setup or additional work. A single unit is also
often cohesive and small, easing the job of the tester.

Of course, unit testing also has some disadvantages:

* **The lack of "reality"**.
A software system is rarely composed of a single class.
The large amount of classes in a system and the interaction between these classes can make the system to behave differently in its real application than in the unit tests.
Hence, unit tests do not perfectly represent the real execution of a software system.

* Another disadvantage that follows from this is that **some bugs simply cannot be caught at unit test level**. Different types of bugs only happen in the integration of the different components (which we are not exercising in a pure unit test).

## System testing

Unit tests indeed do not exercise the system in its entirety (but again, that is not their goal).
To get a more realistic view of the software, and thus, perform more realistic tests, 
we should run the entire software system, with all its 
databases, front-end apps, and whatever other components it is composed of.

When we test the system in its entirely, we are doing what it is called **system testing**.
In practice, instead of testing small parts of the system in isolation, system tests execute the system as a whole.
Note that we can also call system testing as **black box testing**, because the system is some sort of black box to the tests:
we do not care or actually know what goes on inside of the system ("the black box") as long as we get the expected output for a given input.

The obvious advantage of system testing is **how realistic the tests are**.
After all,
the more realistic the tests are, the higher the chances of it actually working when shipped.

System tests also **capture the user's perspective** more than unit tests do.
In other words, system tests are just a better simulation of how the final 
user interacts with the system.

However, system testing also has its downsides.
**System tests are often slow when compared to unit tests**.
Although we have not written any system test up to now, imagine that a system test
has to start and run the whole system, with all its components. The test also has to interact
with the real application, and actions might take a few seconds to happen. Imagine a 
test that starts container with a web application, and another container with a database. 
It then submits an HTTP request to a webservice that is exposed by this web app. This webservice
then retrieves data from the database and writes a JSON response to the test.
This definitely takes
more time than running a simple unit test, which has virtually no dependencies at all.

System tests are also **harder to write**.
Some of the components, e.g., databases, might require complex setup before 
they can be used in a testing scenario. Think of not only connection and authentication,
but also making sure that the database has all the data that is required by that
test case.
This takes additional code that is needed just for automating the tests.

Lastly, **system tests tend to become flaky**.
A flaky test is a test that presents an erratic behaviour: if you run it, it might pass,
or it might fail. Flaky tests are an important problem for software development teams. 
After all, having a test that might pass when there is a bug, or might fail when there is 
no bug, harms the productivity of the development team. It is easy to imagine how
a system test can become flaky. Imagine a system test that exercises a web app. After clicking
at a button, the HTTP POST request to the web app took half a second
more than usual (due to small variations we often do not control in 
real-life scenarios; Tomcat decided to do a full garbage collection at 
that very second, for example). The test was not expecting it to happen, and thus,
it failed. If the test is executed again, the web app might now take its usual time to respond,
and now the test will pass. There are just too many uncertanties in a system test that
can lead to unexpected behaviour.

We discuss _flaky tests_ more formally later in the book.

## Integration testing

Unit and system testing are the two extremes of test levels.
As we saw, unit tests focus on the smallest parts of the system, 
while system tests focus on the whole system at once.
However, testers sometimes need something in between.

**Integration testing** is the test level we use when we need something more
integrated (or less isolated) than a unit test, but without the need of exercising
the entire system.

Let us look at a real-world integration test example.
Software systems commonly rely on database systems. To communicate with the 
database, developers often create a class whose only responsibility is to interact 
with this external component (think of _Data Access Objects_, also known as DAO, classes).
These DAOs might contain complicated SQL code. Thus, a tester feels the need to
test these SQL queries.

However, note that the tester does not want to test the entire system, but solely
the integration between the DAO class to the database. The tester also does not want
to test the DAO class in complete isolation; after all, the best way to know whether
a SQL query works is to actually submit it to the database and see what the database
returns back. This is an example of an integration test.

The goal of integration testing is to test 
multiple components of a system together, but not the whole system.
These integration tests focus on the interaction between these few components of the system.
Are they communicating correctly? What happens if component A sends message X to component B? 
Do they still present correct behaviour?

The advantage of integration tests is that, while not fully isolated, devising tests 
just for a specific integration is easier than devising tests for all the components together. 
As a consequence, the effort of writing such tests
is a bit higher than when compared to unit tests, but lower when compared to system tests. 

Note that the more integrated our tests are, the harder it is to write them. 
In the example, setting up a database for the test requires effort.
Tests that involve databases usually need to
make use of an isolated instance of the database just for testing purposes (as you 
probably do not want your tests to mess with production data), update
the database schema (in fast companies, database schemas are changing all the
time, and the test database needs to keep up), put the database into a state that
the test expects by adding or removing rows, and clean everything afterwards (so that
the next tests do not fail because of the data that was left behind by the previous test).
The same effort happens to any other type of integration test you can imagine, e.g.,
web services, file reads and writes.

## The Testing Pyramid

We discussed three different test levels: unit, system, and integration. 
A question that a pragmatic software developer might be asking themself is:
_How much should I do of each?_

Testers have to decide whether to invest more in unit testing or in system testing. Or to 
decide which components should be tested via unit testing and which components
should be tested via system testing. A wrong decision might have a deep impact in the
quality of the system: a wrong level might cost too much resources, and might not find
sufficient bugs.

While we still have no clear empirical answer to this question, practitioners have been
proposing different ways of making this decision.

One of the most famous diagram that help us in this discussion 
is the so-called **testing pyramid**.

![Testing pyramid, extracted from Fowler's wiki](img/testing-pyramid/testing_pyramid.svg)

The diagram indicates all the test levels we discussed, plus *manual testing*. 
Note that the more you go to the top of the diagram, the more
real the test is (as we discuss, system tests are more real than unit tests); 
however, the more complex it is to devise it.

**How much should we do of each then?** The common practice in industry is also represented in the diagram. The size of the pyramid slice represents the the amount of test one would want of each test level. 

Unit test is at the bottom of the pyramid, and has the largest area of them all. This means 
that testers should favour unit testing.
The reasons for this have been discussed before: they are fast, require less effort 
to be written, and gives developers easier control.

Going up in the diagram, we see that the next level is integration tests. The area
is a bit smalle, indicating that, in practice, we should do integration tests "a bit less"
than unit tests.
Given the extra effort that integration tests require,
testers should make sure to write tests only for the integrations they indeed need.
The diagram continues, showing that testers should then favor system tests a bit less than
integration tests, and even less manual tests.

It is really clear that this diagram has a focus in **costs**. Unit tests are cheaper than
system tests (and manual tests), and thus, they should be preferred.

The next question is **how do I decide whether a component should be tested at unit- or
system-level?**. Practitioners have devised guidelines, which we present below
(you should take with a grain of salt; after all, software systems are different from each other, and might require specific guidelines):

* **When to write unit tests?**
When the component is about an algorithm or a single business logic of the software system.
If we think of enterprise/business systems, most of the business are about "transforming
some data into another". These business logics are often expressed by means of entity classes 
(e.g., an _Invoice_ class and a _Order_ class) exchanging messages. Business logic often do
not depend on external services. And thus, such business logics can be easily tested and fully exercised by means of unit tests. Unit tests will give testers a full control in terms of 
the input data, as well as full observability in terms of asserting that the behaviour was
as expected.

In here, a pragmatic comment would be that if you have a piece of code that deals
with a specific business logic, but you are not able to test it via unit test (e.g.,
it is only possible to exercise that business logic with the full system running), it is probably
because of previous design or architectural decisions that prevent you from writing unit tests.
The way you design your classes has a high impact on how easy it is to write unit tests
for your code. We discuss more about design for testability in a future chapter.

* **When to write integration tests?** Whenever the component under test 
interacts with an external component, e.g., a database or a web service, 
integration tests are the way to go. Following our example in the integration testing
section, a Data Access Object class is better tested at integration level.

Again, note that integration tests are more expensive and harder to be setup than a unit
test. Thus, making sure that the component that performs the integration is _solely_ responsible
for that integration and nothing else (i.e., no business rules together with
integration code), will reduce the cost of the testing.


* **When to write system tests?**
As we know, system tests are very costly. This makes it impossible for testers to
re-test their entire system at system level. Therefore, in here, the suggestion is
to use a risk-based approach. What are the absolutely critical parts of the software system
under test? In other words, what are the parts of the system that a bug would have a high
impact? These are the ones where the tester should focus on system tests.

Of course, such critical parts must also be tested at other levels. Remember the
_pesticide paradox_: a single technique is usually not enough to identify all the bugs.

* **When to perform manual tests?** 
Manual testing has lots of disadvantages, but sometimes impossible to avoid. However,
even in cases where automation is fully possible, manual exploratory testing can
be useful. 
The wikipedia page on [Exploratory Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing)
is well written and we point the reader to it.


On the other hand, those who apply the _testing pyramid_ try to avoid 
the so-called *ice cream cone*. Imagine the testing pyramid, but put upside down.
In this new version, manual testing has the largest area, which means one
should put more effort in manual testing (!!).

![Ice cream cone](img/testing-pyramid/ice_cream_cone.svg)

At this point, we do not have to explain why fully relying on manual testing is a bad.
Unfortunately, it is common to see development teams 
mostly relying on manual tests in their quality assurance processes. 
Often, these teams also have a small amount of system tests. Not because they 
believe on the efficiency of system tests, but because the system was so badly 
designed, that unit and integration tests are just impossible to be done.
We will discuss design for testability in future chapters.

## A remark on the testing pyramid

We have no scientific evidence that the testing pyramid or, the idea
of prioritizing design for testability and focusing on unit tests, is efficient.
However, the software development community of practice has been relying on it
for years and companies, from small to large sizes, have been advocating it.

That being said, in our point of view, the testing pyramid approach is viable
in most of enterprise / business systems. Imagine an [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) or a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) system. Most business rules there can be expressed
by classes/units exchanging messages and tranforming data. Unit tests will then pay off
as testers can easily gain control and observability of the actions of the system.

However, in many other systems, unit testing might not be enough. Imagine the
development of a 
database management system itself, e.g., MySQL, Oracle, or a distributed computing system
like Hadoop. While MySQL's code probably contains
lots of individual components that can be unit tested, a lot happens at "low-level", 
like disk I/O or socket communication. In these cases, maybe system tests are the ones
that would reveal most of the important bugs. 

The same might happen with cyber-physical systems. Imagine a water management station.
Although a lot of software is going on there, the system highly depends on 
physical constraints, such as the dynamics of water that affects the reading 
of the water level sensors. In such situations, it can be challenging, or maybe
too unrealistic to write unit tests.

The message here is that, although the testing pyramid makes sense in lots of systems
that are developed in industry, for some others, it might not be the best way of
making trade-offs. You, as a tester, should understand the advantages and the disadvantages
of each test level, what each test level can give back, as well as their costs,
and then, decide which test levels to use, how much, and when. There is no silver bullet.


## Exercises


**Exercise 1.**
Now we have a skeleton for the testing pyramid.
What words/sentences should be at the numbers?

![Testing Pyramid exercise skeleton](img/testing-pyramid/exercises/pyramid_skeleton.svg)

(Try to answer the question without scrolling up!)


**Exercise 2.**
As a tester, you have to decide which test level (i.e., unit, integration, or system test) you will apply.
Which of the following statements is true?

1. Integration tests, although more complicated (in terms of automation) than unit tests, would better help in finding bugs in the communication with the webservice and/or the communication with the database.
2. Given that unit tests could be easily written (by using mocks) and they would cover as much as integration tests would, it is the best choice in this problem.
3. The most effective way to find bugs in this code is through system tests. In this case, the tester should run the entire system and exercise the batch process. Given that this code can be easily mocked, system tests would also be cheap.
4. While all the test levels can be used for this problem, testers would likely find more bugs if they choose one level and explore all the possibilities and corner cases there.


**Exercise 3.**
The tester should now write an integration test for the `OrderDao` class below.

```java
public class OrderDeliveryBatch {

  public void runBatch() {

    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();
    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();

    List<Order> orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();

    for(Order order : orders) {
      delivery.start(order);

      if(order.isInternational()) {
        order.setDeliveryDate("5 days from now");
      } else {
        order.setDeliveryDate("2 days from now");
      }
    }
  }
}

class OrderDao {
  // accesses a database
}

class DeliveryStartProcess {
  // communicates with a third-party webservice
}
```

Which one of the following statements **is not required** when writing
an integration test for this class?

1. Reset the database state before each test.
2. Apply the correct schema to the database under test.
3. Assert that any database constraints are met.
4. Set the transaction autocommit to true.




**Exercise 4.**
A newly developed product started off with some basic unit tests but later on decided to only add integration tests and system tests for the new code that was written. This was because a user interacts with the system as a whole and therefore these types of tests were considered more valuable. Thus, unit tests became less prevalent, whereby integration tests and system tests became a more crucial part of the test suite. This transition can be described as:

1. Transitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone pattern
2. Transitioning from an ice-cream cone anti-pattern to a testing pyramid
3. Transitioning form an ice-cream cone pattern to a testing pyramid
4. Transitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern


**Exercise 5.**
TU Delft just built an in-house software to control the payroll of its employees. The applications makes use of Java web technologies and stores data in a Postgres database. Clearly, the application frequently retrieves, modifies, and inserts large amounts of data into the database. All this communication is made by Java classes that send (complex) SQL queries to the database. 

As testers, we know that a bug can be anywhere, including in the SQL queries themselves. We also know that there are many ways to exercise our system. Which one of the following **is not** a good option to detect in the SQL queries?
  
1. Unit testing.
1. Integration testing.
1. System testing.
1. Stress testing.


**Exercise 6.**
Choosing the level of a test is a matter of a trade-off. After all, each 
test level has advantages and disadvantages.
Which one of the following is the **main advantage** of a test at system level?


1. The interaction with the system is much closer to reality.
1. In a continuous integration environment, system tests provide real feedback to developers.
1. Given that system tests are never flaky, they provide developers with more stable feedback.
1. A system test is written by product owners, making it closer to reality.



**Exercise 7.**
What is the main reason for the number of recommended system tests in the testing pyramid to be smaller than the number of unit tests?


1. Unit tests are as good as system tests.
1. System tests do not provide developers with enough quality feedback.
1. There are no good tools for system tests.
1. System tests tend to be slow and often are non-deterministic.
