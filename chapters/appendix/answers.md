# Answers to the exercises

## Principles of software testing

**Exercise 1**

1. Failure, the user notices the system/program behaving incorrectly.
2. Fault, this is a problem in the code, that is causing a failure in this case.
3. Error, the human mistake that created the fault.

**Exercise 2**

The absence-of-errors fallacy.
While the software does not have a lot of bugs, it is not giving the users what they want.
In this case the verification was good, but they need work on the validation.

**Exercise 3**

Exhaustive testing is impossible.

**Exercise 4**

Test early, although an important principle, is definitely not related to the problem of only doing unit tests. All others help people in understanding that variation, different types of testing, is important.


## Introduction to software testing automation

Writing tests is fun, isn't it?




## Specification-based testing


**Exercise 1**

A group of inputs that all make a method behave the same way.


**Exercise 2**

We use the concept of equivalence partitioning to determine which tests can be removed.
According to equivalence partitioning we only need to test one test case in a certain partition.

We can group the tests cases in their partitions:

- Divisible by 3 and 5: T1, T2
- Divisible by just 3 (not by 5): T4
- Divisible by just 5 (not by 3): T5
- Not divisible by 3 or 5: T3

Only the partition where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 has two tests.
Therefore we can only remove T1 or T2.


**Exercise 3**

Following the category partition method:

1. Two parameters: key and value
2. The execution of the program does not depend on the value; it always inserts it into the map.
We can define different characteristics of the key:
      - The key can already be present in the map or not.
      - The key can be null.
3. The requirements did not give a lot of parameters and/or characteristics, so we do not have to add constraints.
4. The combinations are each of the possibilities for the key with any value, as the programs execution does not depend on the value.
We end up with three partitions:
      - New key
      - Existing key
      - null key


**Exercise 4**

We go over each given partition and identify whether it is a valid partition:

1. Valid partition: Invalid numbers, which are too small.
2. Valid partition: Valid numbers
3. Invalid partition: Contains some valid numbers, but the range is too small to cover the whole partition.
4. Invalid partition: Same reason as number 3.
5. Valid partition: Invalid numbers, that are too large.
6. Invalid partition: Contains both valid and invalid letters (the C is included in the domain).
7. Valid partition: Valid letters.
8. Valid partition: Invalid letters, past the range of valid letters.

We have the following valid partitions: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.

**Exercise 5**

* P1: Element not present in the set
* P2: Element already present in the set
* P3: NULL element.

The specification clearly makes the three different cases of the correct answer explicit.


**Exercise 6**

Option 4 is the incorrect one.
This is a functional based technique. No need for source code.


**Exercise 7**

Possible actions:

1. We should treat pattern size 'empty' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.
2. We should constrain the options in the 'occurrences in a single line' category to happen only if 'occurrences in the file' are either exactly one or more than one. % It does not make sense to have none occurrences in a file and one pattern in a line.
3. We should treat 'pattern is improperly quoted' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.



## Boundary testing

**Exercise 1**

The on-point is the value in the conditions: `half`.

When `i` equals `half` the condition is false.
Then the off-point makes the condition true and is as close to `half` as possible.
This makes the off-point `half` - 1.

The in-points are all the points that are smaller than half.
Practically they will be from 0, as that is what `i` starts with.

The out-points are the values that make the condition false: all values equal to or larger than `half`.

**Exercise 2**

The decision consists of two conditions, so we can analyse these separately.

For `n % 3 == 0` we have an on point of 3.
Here we are dealing with an equality; the value can both go up and down to make the condition false.
As such, we have two off-points: 2 and 4.

Similarly to the first condition for `n % 5 == 0` we have an on-point of 5.
Now the off-points are 4 and 6.


**Exercise 3**

The on-point can be read from the condition: 570.

The off-point should make the condition false (the on-point makes it true): 571.

An example of an in-point is 483.
Then the condition evaluates to true.

An example of an out-point, where the condition evaluates to false, is 893.


**Exercise 4**


![Answer domain matrix](img/boundary-testing/exercises/domain_exercise.png)

Note that we require 7 test cases in total: `numberOfPoints <= 570` and `numberOfLives > 10` each have one on- and one off-point.
`energyLevel == 5` is an equality, so we have two off-points and one on-point.
This gives a total of 7 test cases.

For one of the first two conditions we need two typical rows.

Let's rewrite the whole condition to: `(c1 && c2) || c3`.

To test `c1` we have to make `c2` true, otherwise the result will always be false.

The same goes for testing `c2` and then making `c1` true.

However, when testing `c3`, we need to make `(c1 && c2)` false, otherwise the result will always be true.
That is why, when testing `c3`, `c1` or `c2` has to be false, i.e. and out-point instead of an in-point.
Therefore we use two different typical rows for the `numberOfLives` variable.
The same could have been done with two typical rows for the `numberOfPoints` variable.

**Exercise 5**

An on-point is the (single) number on the boundary. It may or may not make the condition true. The off point is the closest number to the boundary that makes the condition to be evaluated to the opposite of the on point. Given it's an inequality, there's only a single off-point.


**Exercise 6**

on point = 1024, off point = 1025, in point = 1028, out point = 512

The on point is the number precisely in the boundary = 1024. off point is the closest number to the boundary and has the opposite result of on point. In this case, 1024 makes the condition false, so the off point should make it true. 1025. In point makes conditions true, e.g., 1028. Out point makes the condition false, e.g., 512.


**Exercise 7**

We should always test the behaviour of our program when any expected data actually does not exist (EXISTENCE).




## Structural-based testing

**Exercise 1**

Example of a test suite that achieves $$100\%$$ line coverage:

```java
@Test
public void removeNullInListTest() {
    LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

    list.add(null);

    assertTrue(list.remove(null));
}

@Test
public void removeElementInListTest() {
    LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

    list.add(7);

    assertTrue(list.remove(7));
}

@Test
public void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {
    LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

    assertFalse(list.remove(5))
}
```

Note that there exists a lot of test suites that achieve $$100\%$$ line coverage, this is just an example.

You should have 3 tests.
At least one test is needed to cover lines 4 and 5 (`removeNullInListTest` in this case).
This test will also cover lines 1-3.

Then a test for lines 9 and 10 is needed (`removeElementInListTest`).
This test also covers lines 6-8.

Finally a third test is needed to cover line 11 (`removeElementNotPresentInListTest`).


**Exercise 2**

![LinkedList exercise CFG](img/structural-testing/exercises/CFG-LinkedList.svg)
L\<number\> in the diagram represents the line number of the code that is in the block or decision.

**Exercise 3**

Option 1 is the false one.

A minimal test suite that achieves 100\% (either basic or full) condition has the same number of tests as a minimal test suite that achieves 100\% branch coverage. All decisions have just a single branch, so condition coverage doesn't make a difference here. Moreover, a test case that exercises lines 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 achieves around 54\% coverage (6/11).




**Exercise 4**

Example of a test suite that achieves $$100\%$$ branch coverage:

```java
@Test
public void removeNullAsSecondElementInListTest() {
  LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

  list.add(5);
  list.add(null);

  assertTrue(list.remove(null));
}

@Test
public void removeNullNotPresentInListTest() {
  LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

  assertFalse(list.remove(null));
}

@Test
public void removeElementSecondInListTest() {
  LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

  list.add(5);
  list.add(7);

  assertTrue(list.remove(7));
}

@Test
public void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {
  LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

  assertFalse(list.remove(3));
}
```

This is just one example of a possible test suite.
Other tests can work just as well.
You should have a test suite of 4 tests.

With the CFG you can see that there are decisions in lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8.
To achieve $$100\%$$ branch coverage each of these decisions must evaluate to true and to false at least once in the test suite.

For the decision in line 1, we need to remove `null` and something else than `null`. This is done with the `removeElement` and `removeNull` tests.

Then for the decision in line 2 the node that `remove` is looking at should not be null and null at least once in the tests.
The node is `null` when the end of the list had been reached.
That only happens when the element that should be removed is not in the list.
Note that the decision in line 2 only gets executed when the element to remove is `null`.
In the tests, this means that the element should be found and not found at least once. 

The decision in line 3 checks if the node that the method is at now has the element that should be deleted.
The tests should cover a case where the element is not the item that has to be removed and a case where the element is the item that should be removed.

The decisions in lines 7 and 8 are the same as in lines 2 and 3 respectively.
The only difference is that lines 7 and 8 will only be executed when the item to remove is not `null`.

**Exercise 5**



First, we find the pairs of tests that can be used for each of the conditions:

- A: {2, 6}
- B: {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 7}
- C: {5, 6}

For A and C we need the decisions 2, 5 and 6.
Then you can choose to add either 4 or 7 to cover condition B.

The possible answers are: {2, 4, 5, 6} or {2, 5, 6, 7}.


**Exercise 6**


![Control Flow Graph answer](img/structural-testing/exercises/CFG-sameEnds.svg)

L\<number\> represents the line numbers that the code blocks cover.


**Exercise 7**


A lot of input strings give 100% line coverage.
A very simple one is `"aa"`.
As long as the string is longer than one character and makes the condition in line 9 true, it will give 100% line coverage.
For `"aa"` the expected output is `"a"`.


**Exercise 8**


Answer 4. is correct.
The loop in the method makes it impossible to achieve 100% path coverage.
This would require us to test all possible number of iterations.
For the other answers we can come up with a test case: `"aXYa"`

**Exercise 9**


First the condition coverage.
We have 8 conditions:

1. Line 1: `n % 3 == 0`, true and false
2. Line 1: `n % 5 == 0`, true and false
3. Line 3: `n % 3 == 0`, true and false
4. Line 5: `n % 5 == 0`, true and false

T1 makes conditions 1 and 2 true and then does not cover the other conditions.
T2 makes all the conditions false.
In total these test cases then cover $$2 + 4 = 6$$ conditions so the condition coverage is $$\frac{6}{8} \cdot 100\% = 75\%$$

Now the decision coverage.
We have 6 decision:

1. Line 1: `n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0`, true and false
2. Line 3: `n % 3 == 0`, true and false
3. Line 5: `n % 5 == 0`, true and false

Now T1 makes decision 1 true and does not cover the other decisions.
T2 makes all the decision false.
Therefore the coverage is $$\frac{4}{6} \cdot 100\% = 66\%$$.


**Exercise 10**



![Control Flow Graph answer](img/structural-testing/exercises/CFG-computeIfPresent.svg)

The L\<number\> in the blocks represent the line number corresponding to the blocks.


**Exercise 11**

Answer: 3.

One test to cover lines 1 and 2.
Another test to cover lines 1, 3-7 and 8-13.
Finally another test to cover lines 14 and 15. This test will also automatically cover lines 1, 3-10.


**Exercise 12**

Answer: 4.

From the CFG we can see that there are 6 branches.
We need at least one test to cover the true branch from the decision in line 1.
Then with another test we can cover false from L1 and false from L8.
We add another test to cover false from the decision in line 10.
Finally an additional test is needed to cover the true branch out of the decision in line 10.
This gives us a minimum of 4 tests.

**Exercise 13**


MC/DC does subsume statement coverage. Basic condition coverage does not subsume branch coverage; full condition coverage does.


**Exercise 14**

Option 1 is correct.


**Exercise 15**



Option 1 is the correct one.

Tests for A = (2,6), B = (2,4), C = (3, 4), (5, 6), (7,8). Thus, from the options, tests 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the only ones that achieve 100% MC/DC. Note that 2, 4, 5, 6 could also be a solution.





## Model-Based Testing

**Exercise 1**

![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/coldhot_state_machine.svg)

You should not need more than 4 states.

**Exercise 2**



![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/coldhot_transition_tree.svg)


**Exercise 3**



<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>temperature reached</td>
    <td>too hot</td>
    <td>too cold</td>
    <td>turn on</td>
    <td>turn off</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Idle</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Cooling</td>
    <td>Heating</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Off</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cooling</td>
    <td>Idle</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heating</td>
    <td>Idle</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Off</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Idle</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

There are 14 empty cells in the table, so there are 14 sneaky paths that we can test.


**Exercise 4**

![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/order_transition_tree.svg)


**Exercise 5**



We have a total of 6 transitions.
Of these transitions the four given in the test are covered and order cancelled and order resumed are not.
This coves a transition coverage of $$\frac{4}{6} \cdot 100\% = 66.7\%$$


**Exercise 6**


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>STATES</td>
    <td colspan="5">Events</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Order received</td>
    <td>Order cancelled</td>
    <td>Order resumed</td>
    <td>Order fulfilled</td>
    <td>Order delivered</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Submitted</td>
    <td>Processing</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Processing</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Cancelled</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Shipped</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cancelled</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Processing</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shipped</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Completed</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Exercise 7**

Answer: 20.

There are 20 empty cells in the decision table.

Also we have 5 states.
This means $$5 \cdot 5 = 25$$ possible transitions.
The state machine gives 5 explicit transitions so we have $$25 - 5 = 20$$ sneak paths.


**Exercise 8**


First we find pairs of decisions that are suitable for MC/DC: (We indicate a decision as a sequence of T and F. TTT would mean all conditions true and TFF means C1 true and C2, C3 false)

- C1: {TTT, FTT}, {FTF, TTF}, {FFF, TFF}, {FFT, TFT}
- C2: {TTT, TFT}, {TFF, TTF}
- C3: {TTT, TTF}, {FFF, FFT}, {FTF, FTT}, {TFF, TFT},

All condition can use the TTT decision, so we will use that.
Then we can add FTT, TFT and TTF.
Now we test each condition individually with it changing the outcome.

It might look line we are done, but MC/DC requires each action to be covered at least once.
To achieve this we add the FFF and TFF decision as test cases.

In this case we need to test each explicit decision in the decision table.


**Exercise 9**


![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/generic_transition_tree.svg)


**Exercise 10**


![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/ads.png)


**Exercise 11**


![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/solution-microwave-statemachine.png)



**Exercise 12**


![](img/model-based-testing/exercises/solution-microwave-transitiontree.png)


**Exercise 13**


There will be one extra super state (ACTIVE), which will be a super-state of the existing WARMING and DEFROSTING states. The edges from ON to WARMING and DEFROSTING will remain.
The two (cancel and time out) outgoing edges from WARMING and DEFROSTING (four edges in total) will be replaced by two edges going out of the super ACTIVE state.
So there will be two fewer transitions.


**Exercise 14**

## Design-by-contracts and property-based testing

**Exercise 1**


`board != null`

For a class invariant the assertions has to assert a class variable.
`board` is such a class variable, unlike the other variables that are checked by the assertions.
The other assertions are about the parameters (preconditions) or the result (postcondition).


**Exercise 2**


The existing preconditions are **not** enough to ensure the property in line 10.

`board` itself cannot be `null` and `x` and `y` will be in its range, but the content of board can still be `null`.
To guarantee the property again the method would have to implicitly assume an invariant, that ensures that no place in `board` is `null`.

In order to do this, we would have to make the constructor ensure that no place in `board` is `null`.
So we have to add an assertion to the constructor that asserts that every value in `board` is not `null`.


**Exercise 3**

The second colleague is correct.

There is a problem in the `Square`'s preconditions.
For the `resetSize` method these are stronger than the `Rectangle`'s preconditions.
We do not just assert that the `width` and `height` should be larger than 0, but they should also be equal.
This violates Liskov's Substitution Principle.
We cannot substitute a `Square` for a `Rectangle`, because we would not be able to have unequal width and height anymore.


**Exercise 4**


Making correct use of a class should never trigger a class invariant violation.
We are making correct use of the class, as otherwise it would have been a precondition violation.
This means that there is a bug in the implementation of the library, which would have to be fixed.
As this is outside your project, you typically cannot fix this problem.


**Exercise 5**

Just like the contracts we have a client and a server.

A 4xx code means that the client invoked the server in a wrong way, which corresponds to failing to adhere to a precondition.

A 5xx code means that the server was not able to handle the request of the client, which was correct.
This corresponds to failing to meet a postcondition.



**Exercise 6**

P' should be equal or weaker than P, and Q' should be equal or stronger than Q.



**Exercise 7**

To make debugging easier.










## Testing pyramid

**Exercise 1**

1. Manual
2. System
3. Integration
4. Unit
5. More reality (interchangeable with 6)
6. More complexity (interchangeable with 5)

See the diagram in the Testing Pyramid section.

**Exercise 2**

The correct answer is 1.

1. This is correct. The primary use of integration tests is to find mistakes in the communication between a system and its external dependencies
2. Unit tests do not cover as much as integration tests. They cannot cover the communication between different components of the system.
3. When using system tests the bugs will not be easy to identify and find, because it can be anywhere in the system if the test fails. Additionally, system tests want to execute the whole system as if it is run normally, so we cannot just mock the code in a system test.
4. The different test levels do not find the same kind of bugs, so settling down on one of the levels is not a good idea.

**Exercise 3**


Option 4 is not required.

Changing the transaction level is not really required. Better would be to actually exercise the transaction policy your application uses in production.


**Exercise 4**


Correct answer: Transitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern


**Exercise 5**


Unit testing.


**Exercise 6**


The interaction with the system is much closer to reality.


**Exercise 7**

System tests tend to be slow and often are non-deterministic.
See https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html!











## Mock Objects

**Exercise 1**

The correct answer is 4.

1. This line is required to create a mock for the `OrderDao` class.
2. With this line we check that the methods calls start with `order` on a `delivery` mock we defined. The method is supposed to start each order that is paid but not delivered.
3. With this line we define the behaviour of the `paidButNotDelivered` method by telling the mock that it should return an earlier defined `list`.
4. We would never see this happen in a test that is testing the `OrderDeliveryBatch` class. By mocking the class we do not use any of its implementation. But the implementation is the exact thing we want to test. In general we never mock the class under test.


**Exercise 2**

You need mocks to both control and observe the behaviour of the (external) conditions you mocked.


**Exercise 3**


Option 1 is the false one. We can definitely get to 100% branch coverage there with the help of mocks.


**Exercise 4**


Only approach 2.

**Exercise 5**

Given that the condition we have in `InvoiceFilter` is `x < 100`, we have:

* On-point: 100. 100 should be out of the returned list of invoices.
* Off-point: 101. 101 should be in the returned list of invoices.
* (Random) In-point: 500.
* (Random off-point): 50.

A single test with these four invoices is a good test for the boundaries of the problem.


## Design for Testability

**Exercise 1**

To test just the `runBatch` method of `OrderDeliveryBatch` (for example in a unit test) we need to be able to use mocks for at least the `dao` and `delivery` objects.
In the current implementation this is not possible, as we cannot change `dao` or `delivery` from outside.
In other words: We want to improve the controllability to improve the testability.

The technique that we use to do so is called dependency injection.
We can give the `dao` and `delivery` in a parameter of the method:

```java
public class OrderDeliveryBatch {

  public void runBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {
    List<Order> orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();

    for (Order order : orders) {
      delivery.start(order);

      if (order.isInternational()) {
        order.setDeliveryDate("5 days from now");
      } else {
        order.setDeliveryDate("2 days from now");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively we can create fields for the `dao` and `delivery` and a constructor that sets the fields:

```java
public class OrderDeliveryBatch {

  private OrderDao dao;
  private DeliveryStartProcess delivery;

  public OrderDeliveryBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {
    this.dao = dao;
    this.delivery = delivery;
  }

  public void runBatch() {
    List<Order> orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();

    for (Order order : orders) {
      delivery.start(order);

      if (order.isInternational()) {
        order.setDeliveryDate("5 days from now");
      } else {
        order.setDeliveryDate("2 days from now");
      }
    }
  }
}
```


**Exercise 2**


The method and class lack controllability.
We cannot change the values that `Calender` gives in the method because the `getInstance` method is static.
Mockito cannot really mock static methods, which is why we tend to avoid using static methods.

We can use dependency injection to make sure we can control the `today` object by using a mock.


**Exercise 3**


The correct answer is 1 and 3.

As we discussed it is very important to keep the domain and infrastructure separated for the testability.
This can be done, for example, by using Ports and Adapters.

Static methods cannot be mocked and are therefore very bad for the controllability of the code.
Code that has low controllability also has a low testability, so replacing the static methods by non-static ones will be very beneficial to the testability.

The large tables and lack of indices do not really influence the testability, especially not when talking about unit tests.
There we end up mocking the classes interacting with the database anyway.

Too many attributes/fields can hurt testability as we might need to create a lot of mocks for just one class under test.
However, the static methods and mixed domain and infrastructure are worse for the testability than a large amount of attributes/fields.


**Exercise 4**


1. Observability: The developer needs to be able to better observe the result.
2. Controllability: The developer has to be able to change (control) a certain variable or field.
3. Controllability: The developer should be able to control what instance of a class the class under test uses.




## Test-Driven Development

**Exercise 1**


1. Write failing test
2. Failing test
3. Make test pass
4. Passing test
5. Refactor

From the explanation above:

**Exercise 2**

How did it feel to practice TDD?


**Exercise 3**

Option 1 is the least important one.

Although a few studies show that the number of tests written by TDD practitioners are often higher than the number of tests written by developers not practicing TDD, this is definitely not the main reason why developers have been using TDD. In fact, among the alternatives, it's the least important one. All other alternatives are more important reasons, according to the TDD literature (e.g., Kent Beck's book, Freeman's and Pryce's book.


**Exercise 4**

Option 1 is not a benefit of TDD. The
TDD literature says nothing about team integration.





## Test code quality

**Exercise 1**

Correct: Both tests are very slow.


**Exercise 2**

Correct answer: Mystery guest


**Exercise 3**


Correct answer: It is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.


**Exercise 4**


Flaky test.

**Exercise 5**

To avoid the flakiness, a developer could have mocked the random function. It does not make sense, the test is about testing the generator and its homogeneity; if we mock, the test looses its purposes.




## Mutation testing

**Exercise 1**

Mutation testing.
